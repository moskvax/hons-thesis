\section{Title}
The research question is still being refined, but the title will be something
along the lines of ``Using data mining techniques to predict the length of stay
or mortality outcome of patients admitted to a major trauma centre".

\section{Abstract}
The aim of the study is to derive a model using various artificial intelligence
and data mining techniques to predict the length of stay and mortality outcomes
of patients that are admitted to a major trauma centre. This model will be
internally validated using data from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. A mobile
application will be developed to assist planning and decision-making for
doctors in the trauma centre. There will also be some room to investigate
whether such a model can be generalised or used by other medical departments to
assist in their resource allocation and treatment preparation.
